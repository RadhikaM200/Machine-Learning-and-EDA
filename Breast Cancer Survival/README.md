![enter image description here](https://github.com/RadhikaM200/Machine-Learning-and-EDA/blob/main/Breast%20Cancer%20Survival/Breast%20Cancer.png?raw=true)

This project contains **Exploratory Data Analysis** done on the **Breast Cancer Dataset** . 

The dataset contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.

We performed **Diagnostic Analysis** in order to find patterns among the data and understand what factors lead to better healing for patients. On the basis of Analysis, **Hypothesis** was  derived.

To get an idea about the type of data, analysis performed and the hypothesis derived,  please check the [Presentation.](https://github.com/RadhikaM200/Machine-Learning-and-EDA/blob/main/Breast%20Cancer%20Survival/Breast%20Cancer%20Survival.pptx)

The detailed analysis can be found in my [R Notebook](https://github.com/RadhikaM200/Machine-Learning-and-EDA/blob/main/Breast%20Cancer%20Survival/Breast%20Cancer%20Survival.Rmd)
and in the corresponding [Python Notebook.](https://github.com/RadhikaM200/Machine-Learning-and-EDA/blob/main/Breast%20Cancer%20Survival/Breast%20Cancer%20Survival.ipynb)

Thank you!
