This project contains **Exploratory Data Analysis** done on the Top 1000 movies dataset in python.  These 1000 movies were compared and analysed on the basis of various attributes like - Duration of the movie (runtime), Genre, Director, Rating, Revenue Earned, Critic Score, and Year of Release. This was worked upon as a part of INSAID project coursework.

To get an overview of the data and the analysis performed, please check the [presentation](https://github.com/RadhikaM200/Machine-Learning-and-EDA/blob/main/Top-1000-Movies-Dataset/EDA%20on%20movies%20dataset.pptx).

The outcome expected from this notebook will be **conclusions** derived from the data after applying EDA and **actionable insights suggested**, to improve **revenue, ratings and metascore.**
